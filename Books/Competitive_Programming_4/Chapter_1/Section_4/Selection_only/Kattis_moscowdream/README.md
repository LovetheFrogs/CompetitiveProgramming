# Problem moscowdream - Moscow Dream

For many students, getting a ticket to The ICPC World Finals is a huge achievement, and The 2019 ICPC Asia Danang Regional Contest is a chance to make their dream come true. For some others, they just like to stretch their brains and solve interesting problems.

We – the scientific committee understand that, and we tried our best to set up a problemset that is interesting and diverse in both topics and difficulty. For a few months, we called for problem proposals from many people and received *a*
easy problems, *b* medium problems and *c* hard problems. Using these proposals, we want to create a problemset which:

* Consists of **exactly** *n* problems,
* Has at least 1 easy problem,
* Has at least 1 medium problem,
* Has at least 1 hard problem.

Your task is to check whether it is possible to create such a problemset using the available problems.

## Input

The input contains 4 integers *a*, *b*, *c* and *n* (0 ≤ *a, b, c* ≤ 10, 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 20).

## Output

Print ‘YES’ if it is possible to create a problemset satisfying above requirements, and ‘NO’ otherwise.

## Sample Inputs

**Sample Input 1**

```

## Sample Outputs
